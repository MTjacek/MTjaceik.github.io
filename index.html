            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I've been coding seriously since the beginning of high school, mastering a number of coding languages and computer science topics, with web design skills and vast knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have proficiency in many languages used in software such as Python and C++.</p> <!-- Corrected spelling and grammar -->

            <h2>Project Skills</h2>
            <p>I bring a number of unique skills to the table when it comes to computer-related projects as a whole. I have in-depth knowledge of cryptography, both the mathematical side and the code. I'm familiar with the inner workings of the Windows operating system as well as multiple distributions of Linux. The most important thing, however, is the way I organize and dedicate myself to an individual project, setting personal deadlines and quotas for daily, weekly, and monthly work.</p> <!-- Corrected spelling and grammar -->
